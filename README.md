# Ultrasonic-Distance-measurement-device
Ultrasonic Distance Measurement Device built using Arduino Uno, HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, and OLED display. This project measures distance in real-time and displays the result on the OLED screen. A push button allows switching between different distance units (centimeters, inches, meters, feet) for flexibility
